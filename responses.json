  "what_is": "Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new virus that has not been previously identified. 'CO' stands for 'corona,' 'VI' for 'virus,' and 'D' for disease. \n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. \n\nCOVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.",
  "how_spread": "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. \n WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.",
  "spread_no_sick": "The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. ",
  "spread_objects": "It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads",
  "spread_after_quarantine": "Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.",
  "symptoms": "COVID-19 can present with symptoms between two and 14 days following exposure. \n\nThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",
  "what_to_do": "DO NOT GO to the hospital! The first step is to contact your primary care physician. They can recommend proper treatment and, if necessary, notify public health officials.",
  "most_at_risk": "Anyone can contract COVID-19, but to date, severe cases have mostly been limited to the elderly and those with existing chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory disease.",
  "poultry": "There is no indication that farm animals can become infected with coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) or that they can transmit the virus to humans.",
  "children": "Children seem to be contributing little to the spread of COVID-19. They can play with others if they do not have any symptoms. Large groups should be avoided.",
  "medications": "There is (yet) no medication against the novel Corona virus.To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Paracetamol and ibuprofen do not help to cure the virus but can reduce symptoms of fever, sore throat and malaise. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. \n Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. \n The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. ",
  "masks": "Face masks are recommend medical personnel only. Why? You should use special masks that close very well over your nose and mouth, use them precisely and change them regularly. This is almost impossible in daily use. \n The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. ",
  "incubation": "The 'incubation period' means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days.",
  "prevention": "*Protection measures for everyone* \n\nYou can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: \n\n‚úì Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.\n‚úì Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.\n*‚úì*Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.\n‚úì Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.\n‚úì Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.\n‚úì Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ‚Äì especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.",
  "incubation": "Hand dryers are not effective in preventing COVID-19, and should be avoided when hands are not properly cleaned.",
  "water": "Public drinking water supplies are safe to drink (should avoid touching the spout and lever around though).",
  "pets": "There is a possibility for some animals to become infected through close contact with infected humans. Further evidence is needed to understand if animals and pets can spread the disease; \n Based on current evidence, human to human transmission remains the main driver. \n There is no reason to think that animals might be a source of infection with this new virus.."
